The objective of this project is to build a complete and reusable framework for Orthogonal Persistence (Atkinson & Morrison, 1995) in concurrent environments with support for database evolutions and transactions.
The current version already is capable of freeing the programmer of implementing any read or writes data operations.
Additionally, it provides semi-automatic means for database evolution in a multi-version schema.
We are working on the support for transactions.
This prototype is supported by an object oriented database and, in the future, will also use a relational database.
